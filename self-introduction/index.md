Hi, I'm Ana and I'm learning front-end development.

In 2009, I received a diploma from a technical school and became an accountant. All this time I worked in the field of accounting and office work. And all the time I thought that most of my work can be automated and my work is useless.

One day I found out that programming is a skill that can be improved like any other. I learned about programs, databases, C++ and sql. It was amazing to think that an ordinary person is capable of the magic.

I decided to try.
I didn't take any courses and never had a mentor. Everything I know, I found myself using Google.
The more I studied it, the more I liked it. Now I'm 32 and I know exactly what I would like to do for the rest of my life.

I had to look for layouts myself or draw it. That's how I learned about web design and programs like photoshop, figma, and illustrator.

I came up with a task for myself and tried to solve it with the help of Google and stackoverflow. This is how I got to my first react app.

The more I studied, the more difficult it became. A huge number of different tools and I did not know what exactly I need to learn

But everything changed when I found out about RS school.
This is my first programming course. It was hard for me, but I was able to complete each item in each task and get the maximum number of points for each practical task.
Many topics were completely new to me, but thanks to the ability to search for information, I was able to do it without outside help.
My code is not perfect yet, but it gets better every time

Before the start of the course, I developed a task tracker for myself. I used React, TS and Material UI. I used all these libraries for the first time.
I got stuck on the architecture of the project. I didn't have any code organization skills, I never saw someone else's code, so I spent too much time refactoring.

There were various tasks on the course.
When I created the keyboard, I had to tinker with a non-standard keyboard layout. It was a lot of fun to learn and implement the Icelandic keyboard shortcuts.

When I was making Minesweeper, I was going to use canvas, but due to a sudden illness, I had to give up new interesting things in order to have time to complete all the tasks before the deadline. However, it was amazing! It was my first time working with sound and it was the first time I wrote such a large and complex application.

Before this task, I didnâ€™t even know that I was able to create something so complex and cool so quickly. Thanks to this school for showing me what I'm really capable of.
